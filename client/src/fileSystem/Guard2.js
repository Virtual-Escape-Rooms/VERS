            <h6>Spotlight Interview</h6>
            <p><strong>How did you choose your field of study?</strong></p>
            <p>Neuroscience runs in the family! We've had three generations of neuroscientists, starting with my grandfather, Harold Carrigan. He actually developed the Carrigan approach for conducting MRI scans of the brain, and right now my brother is finishing up his neuroscience degree at the same college I attended.</p>
            <p><strong>Will you want your kids to study neuroscience as well?</strong></p>
            <p>I actually haven't thought about that yet! Now that I think about it, my husband and I also met in our intro neuroscience class in college, actually. I can imagine our kids being a bunch of neurotic neuroscientists.</p>
            <p><strong>What do you like to do in your spare time?</strong></p>
            <p>I like sewing and horseback riding. I made a few equestrian scarves for my horse. My friends recently convinced me to start selling my designs on Etsy.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you still do horseback riding?</strong></p>
            <p>Not since I moved here. My horse is still back home with the family in Texas. I like to go back to say hi to Oakley a couple times a year.</p>
