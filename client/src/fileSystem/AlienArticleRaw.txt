Laboratory setup complete. After deeming New York City incompatible, we have established our headquarters in what the Earth inhabitants call Nevada, United States. Here there is plenty of open territory for experimentation, and we are free of the constant scrutiny of a dense city population.

The last of the damage we left in 2015 New York has now been taken care of. The native species are afflicted with a condition that causes them to only see happenings through a local neural storage mechanism that they call "memory". We have found that our "flash" technology is capable of removing or modifying such "memory" to distort their perception of our landing on this Earth planet. Our campaign to modify the "memory" of the inhabitants of New York has yielded a 99.7% success rate. All physical and digital records of our presence on the Earth planet have been destroyed.

Under the guise of a secret United States government agency, the Department of Extraterrestrial Investigation, we will continue to study the native species of the Earth planet without eliciting suspicion from the population. As of date, we have captured seventy subjects for further scientific studies on the workings of this unique biological phenomenon that is "memory". We hope to collect data, achieve a better understanding, and report our findings back to the Intergalactic Association of Science.
